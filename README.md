# cd2-7x10-stash
Expanded stash (70 slots) for Classic Diablo II v1.0-1.06

**Description:**
Simple modification that expands available space for gear (stash only) to be used with older patches of Diablo II (pre-expansion). Should work with versions 1.0 to 1.06b.

**Usage:**
Copy "data" directory into D2 root folder and launch via "-direct -txt". Only use on newly created characters.

**Credits:**
Based on "Mega Inventory Kit" mod made by Fusman for [Phrozen Keep](https://d2mods.info/). Files were actually obtained from "Diablo 2++" mod by Rana Loreus, since original working version for old Classic Diablo II was nowhere be found. 
Extended cube/character inventory functionality was removed. Graphic for stash was made anew using original D2 assetes, with clean design as a goal.
